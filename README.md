Work-in-progress. Not even sure if this is a good idea, or a good way to do it.

Here are some GitHub accounts worth keeping an eye on for projects related to Acorn's microcomputers.

Here's an unsorted list of projects, all related to Acorn's microcomputers.

[beebasm](https://github.com/tom-seddon/beebasm)
Assembler designed specially for developing assembler programs for the BBC Micro. It uses syntax reminiscent of BBC BASIC's built-in assembler, and is able to output its object code directly into emulator-ready DFS disc images.
